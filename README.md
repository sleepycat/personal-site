# Personal site

This is a basic business card web page hosted at [mikewilliamson.dev](https://mikewilliamson).
This is mostly a toy website I use to learn things about Google Cloud and host svg icons I use in d2 diagrams.
The current incarnation comes from following [Google's static site hosting hosting tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#storage-create-bucket-gcloud)
